##  Objectives

Basic types in TypeScript → TypeScript includes string, number, boolean, any, void, and null/undefined for defining values.

Interfaces, Classes, and Functions → Interfaces define object structures, classes enable OOP, and functions add typed logic.

How to work with the DOM and TypeScript → TypeScript allows you to safely manipulate the DOM with document.querySelector and dedicated types (HTMLElement).

Generic types → Generic types (T) make code reusable and adaptable to different types.

How to use namespaces → Namespaces organize code into modules to avoid naming conflicts.

How to merge declarations → TypeScript automatically merges interface or type declarations with the same name.

How to use an ambient namespace to import an external library → Ambient modules (declare module "lib") allow you to use an untyped library in TypeScript.

Basic nominal typing with TypeScript → TypeScript is based on structural typing but can simulate nominal typing with advanced techniques (unique symbol).
